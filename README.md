# Normalize.less

This is a [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) port of Nicolas Gallagher's [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/). I originally used this in my front-end framework [Concise](http://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css-less). This port comes in two forms: an all-inclusive file (`_normalize.less` in the root folder) as well as an abstracted set of files (found in the `/abstracted` folder).

## Quickstart

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/keenanpayne/normalize.less/archive/master.zip)

2. Include in your LESS project via `@import` or compile and include in your HTML file (`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="normalize.css">`)

## SASS Version

I have ported this code to [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) so if you prefer that as your preprocessor, check out the repo here: [https://github.com/keenanpayne/normalize.scss](https://github.com/keenanpayne/normalize.scss).

## Acknowledgements

Normalize was originally created by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas) and [Jonathan Neal](https://github.com/jonathantneal). Big thanks to them for the great tool!
